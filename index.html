        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
            It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment
            (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
            objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
            them.
          </p>

          <p>
            JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
            Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
            operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
            be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
            additional objects; for example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
              objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
              For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
              elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
              clicks, form input, and page navigation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
              objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
              server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
              database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
              another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
              server.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <h2>What you should already know</h2>
        <article>
          <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web
              (WWW).
            </li>
            <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
            <li>
              Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try
              one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.

        <h2>JavaScript and Java</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
            different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
            does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
            JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions
            and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was
            renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
          </p>

          <p>
            In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
            declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
            number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string
            values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the
            more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model
            provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary
            for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without
            any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
            objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
            have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have
            to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
            protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
            parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.
          </p>

      </section>
      <section id="Hello_world">
        <h2>Hello world</h2>
        <article>
          To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write
          your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
          <code
            >function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
            greetMe("World");
          </code>

          Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
          browser!
        </article>
      </section>
      <section id="Variables">
        <h2>Variables</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
            You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
            The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain
            rules.
          </p>
          <p>
            A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
            dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
            Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters
            "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"
            (lowercase).
          </p>
          <p>
            You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in
            identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as
            characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
            Number_hits, temp99, and _name.
          </p>

      <section id="data">
        <h1>JavaScript Data Types</h1>
        <p>JavaScript provides different data types to hold different types of values. There are two types of data types in JavaScript.</p>
        
        <h2>Primitive data type</h2>
        <p>JavaScript has five primitive data types:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>String - represents a sequence of characters, e.g., "hello"</li>
          <li>Number - represents numeric values, e.g., 100</li>
          <li>Boolean - represents a boolean value either false or true</li>
          <li>Undefined - represents an undefined value</li>
          <li>Null - represents null, i.e., no value at all</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Non-primitive data type</h2>
        <p>The non-primitive data types in JavaScript include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Object - represents an instance through which we can access members</li>
          <li>Array - represents a group of similar values</li>
          <li>RegExp - represents a regular expression</li>
          <li>Date - represents a date and time value</li>
          <li>Function - represents a reusable block of code</li>
        </ul>

        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="a">
        <h1>JavaScript If-Else Statement</h1>
  
        <p>
          The if-else statement is used in JavaScript to perform conditional execution of code blocks. It allows you to specify a block of code to be executed if a certain condition is true, and another block of code to be executed if the condition is false.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Syntax:</h2>
        <pre>
          if (condition) {
            // code to be executed if the condition is true
          } else {
            // code to be executed if the condition is false
          }
        </pre>
        
        <h2>Example:</h2>
        <pre>
          <code>
            &lt;script&gt;
              var age = 18;
              
              if (age >= 18) {
                document.write("You are eligible to vote.");
              } else {
                document.write("You are not eligible to vote.");
              }
            &lt;/script&gt;
          </code>
        </pre>
        
        <p>
          In the above example, the variable `age` is checked using the `if` condition. If the age is greater than or equal to 18, the message "You are eligible to vote" is displayed. Otherwise, the message "You are not eligible to vote" is displayed.
        </p>
      </section>
  <section id="x">
    <h2>Loops</h2>
  <p>
    Loops are used in JavaScript to repeatedly execute a block of code. There are three types of loops in JavaScript: <strong>for</strong>, <strong>while</strong>, and <strong>do-while</strong>.
  </p>
  
  <h3>For Loop:</h3>
  <pre>
    <code>
      &lt;script&gt;
        for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
          document.write("Value of i: " + i + "&lt;br&gt;");
        }
      &lt;/script&gt;
    </code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    The above example demonstrates a <strong>for loop</strong> that will iterate from 0 to 4. It prints the value of `i` on each iteration.
  </p>
  
  <h3>While Loop:</h3>
  <pre>
    <code>
      &lt;script&gt;
        var i = 0;
        while (i < 5) {
          document.write("Value of i: " + i + "&lt;br&gt;");
          i++;
        }
      &lt;/script&gt;
    </code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    The above example demonstrates a <strong>while loop</strong> that will iterate as long as the condition `i < 5` is true. It prints the value of `i` on each iteration.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Do-While Loop:</h3>
  <pre>
    <code>
      &lt;script&gt;
        var i = 0;
        do {
          document.write("Value of i: " + i + "&lt;br&gt;");
          i++;
        } while (i < 5);
      &lt;/script&gt;
    </code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    The above example demonstrates a <strong>do-while loop</strong> that will execute the code block at least once, and then continue as long as the condition `i < 5` is true. It prints the value of `i` on each iteration.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Functions</h2>
  <p>
    Functions are blocks of reusable code in JavaScript. They allow you to encapsulate a set of instructions and execute them whenever needed.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Syntax:</h3>
  <pre>
    <code>
      function functionName(parameter1, parameter2, ...) {
        // code to be executed
      }
    </code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    The above syntax demonstrates the declaration of a function named `functionName` with optional parameters.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Example:</h3>
  <pre>
    <code>
      &lt;script&gt;
        function greet(name) {
          document.write("Hello, " + name + "! Welcome to JavaScript.&lt;br&gt;");
        }
        
        greet("John");
        greet("Emily");
      &lt;/script&gt;
    </code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    The above example demonstrates the declaration of a function named `greet` that takes a parameter `name` and prints a greeting message. The function is then called with different arguments (`"John"` and `"Emily"`) to display personalized greetings.

  <h1>JavaScript Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</h1>
  
  <h2>JS Class</h2>
  <p>
    A <strong>class</strong> in JavaScript is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and methods that an object will have. Classes are introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and provide a way to implement OOP concepts in JavaScript.
  </p>
  
  <h2>JS Object</h2>
  <p>
    An <strong>object</strong> in JavaScript is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity with its own set of properties and behaviors. Objects are created using the <code>new</code> keyword and the class constructor.
  </p>
  
  <h2>JS Prototype</h2>
  <p>
    The <strong>prototype</strong> in JavaScript is an object from which other objects inherit properties and methods. It is a mechanism for sharing properties and methods across multiple instances of a class.
  </p>
  
  <h2>JS Constructor Method</h2>
  <p>
    The <strong>constructor method</strong> is a special method in a class that is executed when a new object is created. It is used to initialize the object's properties and set up its initial state.
  </p>
  
  <h2>JS Instance Method</h2>
  <p>
    An <strong>instance method</strong> is a method defined in a class that is available on individual objects created from that class. It operates on the instance-specific data and behavior.
  </p>
  
  <h2>JS Static Method</h2>
  <p>
    A <strong>static method</strong> is a method defined in a class that is called on the class itself, rather than on its instances. It is used for utility functions or operations that are not specific to any particular instance.
  </p>
  
  <h2>JS Encapsulation</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Encapsulation</strong> is a principle of OOP that involves bundling related properties and methods into a single unit, i.e., a class. It allows for data hiding and abstraction, where the internal implementation details are hidden and only the necessary interfaces are exposed.
  </p>
  
  <h2>JS Inheritance</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Inheritance</strong> is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. It promotes code reuse and allows for creating specialized classes based on existing classes.
  </p>
  
  <h2>JS Polymorphism</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Polymorphism</strong> is a concept in OOP that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables methods to be overridden in derived classes and provides flexibility in working with objects of different types through a common interface.
  </p>
  
  <h2>JS Abstraction</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Abstraction</strong> is a principle of OOP that focuses on providing only essential information and hiding unnecessary details. It allows for creating abstract classes and methods that define a common interface without providing concrete implementations.
